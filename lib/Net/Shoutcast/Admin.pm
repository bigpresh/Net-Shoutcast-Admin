This document describes Net::Shoutcast::Admin version 0.0.2


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::Shoutcast::Admin;

    my $shoutcast = Net::Shoutcast::Admin->new(
                                    host => 'server hostname',
                                    port => 8000,
                                    admin_password => 'mypassword',
    );
    
    if ($shoutcast->source_connected) {
        printf "%s is currently playing %s by %s",
            $shoutcast->dj_name,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A module to interact with Shoutcast servers to retrieve information about
their current status (and perhaps in later versions of the module, to also
control the server in various ways).


=head1 INTERFACE 

=over 4

=item new

$shoutcast = Net::Shoutcast::Admin->new( %params );

Creates a new Net::Shoutcast::Admin object.  Takes a hash of options
as follows:

=over 4

=item host

The hostname of the Shoutcast server you wish to query.

=item port

The port on which Shoutcast is running.  Defaults to 8000 if not specified.

=item admin_password

The admin password for the Shoutcast server.

=item timeout

The number of seconds to wait for a response.  Defaults to 10 seconds if
not specified.

=item agent

The HTTP User-Agent header which will be sent in HTTP requests to the Shoutcast
server.  If not supplied, a suitable default will be used.
