Net-Shoutcast-Admin - Perl module to interact with Shoutcast servers

A quick module to interact with Shoutcast servers.  Currently supports fetching
information about the current status of a shoutcast server; future improvements
will add ability to perform actions such as kicking the current source, banning
IPs etc, and may add Icecast support too.

This module is still at a very early stage; if you find it useful, feel free
to let me know to help encourage further development :)
